# IMAGE GENERATOR by ChatGPT

A small warming-up exercise to utilize ChatGPT and Web API to make a simple website before kick-off new projects.

I have never used ChatGPT when I have coded so far because my goal was to practice coding from scratch understand the fundamentals (syntax, grammar, features, etc.) well, and overcome the fear of facing errors on my own(of course I've got help from online materials such as Googling, etc.) during the process I search, get help, and review.

However, in this real world, Utilizing useful advanced-tech tools has become normal and super important for many reasons:

1. Productivity Enhancement
2. Problem-Solving Assistance
3. Continuous Learning

No worries, we human beings still need to learn technologies and tackle many issues to solve even though AI helps us.
